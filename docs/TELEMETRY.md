# Telemetry

PTK collects anonymous, aggregate usage metrics once per day to help improve the product. Telemetry is **disabled by default** and requires explicit consent during `ptk init` or `ptk telemetry enable`.

## Data Collector

**Entity**: `the PTK fork maintainers`
**Contact**: the GitHub issue tracker (https://github.com/riaku/ptk/issues)

## Why we collect telemetry

PTK supports 100+ commands across 15+ ecosystems. Without telemetry, we have no way to know:

- Which commands are used most and need the best filters
- Which filters are underperforming and need improvement
- Which ecosystems to prioritize for new filter development
- How much value PTK delivers to users (token savings in $ terms)
- Whether users stay engaged over time or churn after trying PTK

This data directly drives our roadmap. For example, if telemetry shows that 40% of users run Python commands but only 10% of our filters cover Python, we know where to invest next.

## How it works

1. **Once per day** (23-hour interval), PTK sends a single HTTPS POST to our telemetry endpoint
2. The ping runs in a **background thread** and never blocks the CLI (2-second timeout)
3. A marker file prevents duplicate pings within the interval
4. If the server is unreachable, the ping is silently dropped — no retries, no queue

**Source code**: [`src/core/telemetry.rs`](../src/core/telemetry.rs)

## What is collected

### Identity (anonymous)

| Field | Example | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `device_hash` | `a3f8c9...` (64 hex chars) | Count unique installations. SHA-256 of a per-device random salt stored locally (`~/.local/share/ptk/.device_salt`). Not reversible. No hostname or username included. |

### Environment

| Field | Example | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `version` | `0.34.1` | Track adoption of new versions |
| `os` | `macos` | Know which platforms to support and test |
| `arch` | `aarch64` | Prioritize ARM vs x86 builds |
| `install_method` | `script` | Understand distribution channels (script/cargo/other) |

### Usage volume

| Field | Example | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `commands_24h` | `142` | Daily activity level |
| `commands_total` | `32888` | Lifetime usage — segment light vs heavy users |
| `top_commands` | `["git", "cargo", "ls"]` | Most popular tools (names only, max 5) |
| `tokens_saved_24h` | `450000` | Daily value delivered |
| `tokens_saved_total` | `96500000` | Lifetime value delivered |
| `savings_pct` | `72.5` | Overall effectiveness |

### Quality (filter improvement)

| Field | Example | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `passthrough_top` | `["git:15", "npm:8"]` | Top 5 commands with 0% savings — these need filters |
| `parse_failures_24h` | `3` | Filter fragility — high count means filters are breaking |
| `low_savings_commands` | `["ptk docker ps:25%"]` | Commands with weighted savings rate <30%, net-negative ones included — filters to improve. Rate is `SUM(saved)/SUM(input)` over every call of the command, the same figure as the `ptk gain` By Command table, so high-volume calls are not diluted by passthrough calls. Exact 0% is left to `passthrough_top`. |
| `avg_savings_per_command` | `68.5` | Unweighted average across distinct command names (each filter counts once regardless of invocation volume). Each command's individual rate is weighted by volume before the outer average; commands that never had any input are skipped. |
| `recall_mode` | `sqlite` | Which recovery mode is active (`sqlite`/`tee`/`disabled`) |
| `recall_stats` | `[{"filter":"grep","mode":"sqlite","elisions":142,"recalls":9}]` | Per-filter counters: how often elided output is retrieved — calibrates filter caps. Filter names come from a fixed allowlist of PTK filter families; anything else is folded into `other`. No hashes, no paths, no command arguments, no output content. |

### Ecosystem distribution

| Field | Example | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `ecosystem_mix` | `{"git": 45, "cargo": 20, "js": 15}` | Category percentages — where to invest filter development |

### Retention (engagement)

| Field | Example | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `first_seen_days` | `45` | Installation age in days |
| `active_days_30d` | `22` | Days with at least 1 command in last 30 days — measures stickiness |

### Economics

| Field | Example | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `tokens_saved_30d` | `12000000` | 30-day token savings for trend analysis |
| `estimated_savings_usd_30d` | — | A USD value derived from the estimated tokens saved and a fixed internal constant. It is not a measured cost and does not reflect any provider's pricing |

### Adoption

| Field | Example | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `hook_type` | `claude` | Which AI agent hook is installed (claude/gemini/codex/cursor/none) |
| `custom_toml_filters` | `3` | Number of user-created TOML filter files — DSL adoption |

### Configuration (user maturity)

| Field | Example | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `has_config_toml` | `true` | Whether user has customized ptk config |
| `exclude_commands_count` | `2` | Commands excluded from rewriting — high count may indicate frustration |
| `projects_count` | `5` | Distinct project paths — multi-project = power user |

### Feature adoption

| Field | Example | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `meta_usage` | `{"gain": 5, "discover": 2}` | Which PTK features are actually used |

## What is NOT collected

- Source code or file contents
- Full command lines or arguments (only tool names like "git", "cargo")
- File paths or directory structures
- Secrets, API keys, or environment variable values
- Repository names or URLs
- Personally identifiable information
- IP addresses (not stored in telemetry pings; stored temporarily in erasure audit log for accountability, anonymized after 6 months)

## Consent

Telemetry requires explicit opt-in consent (GDPR Art. 6, 7). Consent is requested during `ptk init` or via `ptk telemetry enable`. Without consent, no data is sent.

```bash
ptk telemetry status     # Check current consent state
ptk telemetry enable     # Give consent (interactive prompt)
ptk telemetry disable    # Withdraw consent
ptk telemetry forget     # Withdraw consent + delete local data + request server erasure
```

Environment variable override (blocks telemetry regardless of consent):
```bash
export PTK_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
```

## Retention Policy

- **Server-side**: telemetry records are retained for a maximum of **12 months**, then automatically purged (periodic task every 24 hours).
- **Server-side (erasure log)**: IP addresses in the erasure audit log are **anonymized after 6 months** (GDPR — IP is personal data).
- **Client-side**: the local SQLite database (`~/.local/share/ptk/tracking.db`) retains data for **90 days** by default (configurable via `tracking.history_days` in `config.toml`). Deleted entirely by `ptk telemetry forget`.

## Your Rights (GDPR)

Under the EU General Data Protection Regulation, you have the right to:

- **Access** your data: `ptk telemetry status` shows your device hash; the telemetry payload is fully documented above.
- **Rectification**: since data is anonymous and aggregate, rectification is not applicable.
- **Erasure** (Art. 17): run `ptk telemetry forget` to delete local data and send an erasure request to the server. Alternatively, email the GitHub issue tracker (https://github.com/riaku/ptk/issues) with your device hash.
- **Restriction of processing**: `ptk telemetry disable` stops all data collection immediately.
- **Portability**: the local SQLite database at `~/.local/share/ptk/tracking.db` contains all locally stored data.
- **Objection**: `ptk telemetry disable` or `export PTK_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1`.

## Erasure Procedure

1. Run `ptk telemetry forget` — this disables telemetry, deletes your device salt, ping marker, and local tracking database (`history.db`), then sends an erasure request to the server.
2. If the server is unreachable, the CLI prints your full device hash and fallback instructions to email the GitHub issue tracker (https://github.com/riaku/ptk/issues) for manual erasure.
3. You can also email the GitHub issue tracker (https://github.com/riaku/ptk/issues) directly to request manual erasure.

## Data Handling

- Telemetry endpoint URL and auth token are injected at **compile time** via `option_env!()` — they are not in the source code
- All communications use HTTPS (TLS)
- Data is used exclusively for PTK product improvement
- No data is sold or shared with third parties
- Aggregate statistics may be published (e.g. "70% of PTK users are on macOS")

### Server-side Requirements

The telemetry server must implement:
- `POST /erasure` endpoint accepting `{"device_hash": "...", "action": "erasure"}`, authenticated via `X-PTK-Token`
- Automatic periodic purge of telemetry records older than 12 months
- Audit log for erasure requests (GDPR Art. 17(2) accountability) with IP anonymization after 6 months

## For contributors

The telemetry implementation lives in `src/core/telemetry.rs`. Key design decisions:

- **Fire-and-forget**: errors are silently ignored, never shown to users
- **Non-blocking**: runs in a `std::thread::spawn`, 2-second timeout
- **No async**: consistent with PTK's single-threaded design
- **Compile-time gating**: if `PTK_TELEMETRY_URL` is not set at build time, all telemetry code is dead — the binary makes zero network calls
- **23-hour interval**: prevents clock-drift accumulation that a strict 24h interval would cause

When adding new fields:
1. Add the query method to `src/core/tracking.rs`
2. Add the field to `EnrichedStats` in `src/core/telemetry.rs`
3. Populate it in `get_enriched_stats()`
4. Add it to the JSON payload in `send_ping()`
5. Update this document and the README.md privacy table
6. Ensure the field contains only **aggregate counts or anonymized names** — no raw paths, arguments, or user data
